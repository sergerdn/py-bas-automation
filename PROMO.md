🚀 **py-bas-automation: Supercharge BAS with Python!** 🚀

Born from a desire to harness the power of *BrowserAutomationStudio's browser capabilities* while leveraging the
familiarity of *Python*, **py-bas-automation** stands out.

It's more than just a tool — it's the fusion of the best of both worlds, culminating in a robust solution for web
automation aficionados.

💡 **Why I Created It**:

- I needed only the browser component from *BAS*.
- I am more adept in *Python* than other languages.
- I believe the underlying idea can be transposed to any language thanks to the *Chrome DevTools Protocol*.

🚧 **Note**: While I'm passionate about this project, you should understand that this isn't a very serious project.
The main purpose is to deliver a message and share a concept.

🔍 **Key Features**:

- Seamless [BrowserAutomationStudio](https://bablosoft.com/shop/BrowserAutomationStudio) Integration.
- Unique fingerprinting via [FingerprintSwitcher](https://fingerprints.bablosoft.com/) (Paid feature).
- Efficient management with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/).
- Executing Browser Automation Studio Actions from Python: Implement BAS actions from Python using the un-documented
  API. This includes actions such as retrieving page source, **emulating mouse movements**, etc.
  (Note: Not all functions are currently supported).
