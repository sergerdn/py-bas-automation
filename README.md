**Note:** This project originally started as a `working proof of concept` and does not aim to offer extensive support or
documentation. It serves as a fundamental demonstration of the concept and should be considered a foundation for further
development or experimentation.

## Description

This library enables you to work with BAS (BrowserAutomationStudio) using headless Chromium browsers and a
customizable Windows GUI program, while controlling it with Python ❤️.
![bas_gui_window_3.png](docs/images/bas_gui_window_3.png)

## Key Features

- **BrowserAutomationStudio Integration:** Run BAS seamlessly with headless browsers while enjoying the convenience of a
  user-friendly and customizable Windows GUI program
  through [BrowserAutomationStudio](https://bablosoft.com/shop/BrowserAutomationStudio).
- **Unique Fingerprint Feature:** The application includes a unique feature that assigns a  `fingerprint`  to each
  browser instance using [FingerprintSwitcher](https://fingerprints.bablosoft.com/). Please be aware that this is
  **paid** service.
- **Proxy Support:** The application supports proxy providers such as [Brightdata](https://brightdata.com/). Please
  note that this is a **paid** service.
- **Executing Browser Automation Studio (BAS) Actions from Python**: Implement BAS actions from Python using the
  un-documented API. This includes actions such as retrieving page source, emulating mouse movements, etc. (Note: Not
  all functions are currently supported).
- **Playwright Control:** The application leverages [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/) to efficiently manage
  and control BAS.

## Understanding the Workflow

The functioning of BAS (Browser Automation Studio) involves the following steps:

1. **Initial Execution:** Upon initiation, BAS runs [cmd_initial.py](./cmd_initial.py). This script is responsible for
   creating tasks and storing them on the disk for later use.
2. **Data Acquisition and Browser Configuration:** BAS then retrieves the necessary data, configures, and launches
   browser instances based on the tasks provided earlier.
3. **Task Execution:** Following the browser setup, BAS executes [cmd_worker.py](./cmd_worker.py) using the  `task_id`
   and  `remote-debugging-port`  number as command-line parameters.
4. **Task Handling:** [cmd_worker.py](./cmd_worker.py) obtains both the  `ws_endpoint`  and  `remote-debugging-port`
   from the command line. It then manages complex tasks using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/). These tasks
   can range from opening a webpage to filling out forms or even taking screenshots.
5. **Task Completion:** Once the tasks have been completed, BAS terminates the browser instances and exits.

The result of running [cmd_worker.py](./cmd_worker.py) is as follows:

```json
{
  "tasks_file": "C:\\Users\\Administrator\\AppData\\Local\\PyBASProfilesTasks\\tasks.json"
}
```

This is an example of the created `tasks_file`:

```json

    "task_id": "9683607e-2458-4adb-9b14-7e99123bf34d",

      },

## Advanced Usage

This guide introduces a Python script that integrates the `Browser Automation Studio` (BAS) with `py-bas-automation`.
The
purpose is to handle the creation of browser profiles through FingerprintSwitcher and manage tasks related to these
profiles.

### [Initial script: cmd_initial.py](./cmd_initial.py)

### Description:

This script facilitates the integration between `BAS (Browser Automation Studio)` and `py-bas-automation`. It manages
the creation of browser profiles using `FingerprintSwitcher` and generates tasks associated with these profiles.

### Overview:

- **Initialization**: Import essential modules and configure logging.
- **Browser Profiles**: Utilize `FingerprintSwitcher`'s fingerprint key to generate or manage browser profiles.
- **Proxy Support**: Configure proxy settings for each browser profile in full-automatic mode by handling proxy
  providers. Note: at the moment only [`Brightdata`](https://brightdata.com/) is supported.
- **Tasks Generation**: Generate an associated task for each browser profile and store it.

```python

### [Worker script: cmd_worker.py](./cmd_worker.py)

### Description:

This script demonstrates how to execute tasks using the `Playwright` Python library in conjunction with the
`pybas_automation` package. The primary goal is to fetch task data, connect to an existing browser instance using
`Playwright`, and perform actions on a webpage.

### Overview:

- **Initialization**: Import necessary libraries and set up our task id and debugging port.
- **Task Storage**: Fetch a specific task from our task storage.
- **Remote Browser Connection**: Use the remote debugging port to get a WebSocket endpoint, which allows us to connect
  to an existing browser instance.
- **Executing Browser Automation Studio (BAS) Actions from Python**: Implement BAS actions from Python using the
  un-documented API. This includes actions such as retrieving page source, emulating mouse movements, etc. (Note: Not
  all functions are currently supported).

```python
import asyncio
from uuid import UUID
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright
from pybas_automation.task import TaskStorage, TaskStorageModeEnum
from pybas_automation.browser_automator import BrowserAutomator


async def main():
    # 1. Initialization
    # For demonstration purposes, we're using hardcoded values. In a real scenario, these will be fetched dynamically.
    task_id = UUID("some_task_id_that_we_getting_from_cmd_line_from_BAS")
    remote_debugging_port = 9222
    # A unique identifier for the `Worker.exe` process. Retrieved from the command line  argument `--unique-process-id`.
    unique_process_id = "some_unique_process_id"

    # 2. Task Storage
    # Create a new task storage instance in READ mode to fetch tasks.
    task_storage = TaskStorage(mode=TaskStorageModeEnum.READ)
    found_task = task_storage.get(task_id=task_id)
    # Note: You can manipulate or inspect the `found_task` as needed.

    # 3. Remote Browser Connection
    async with BrowserAutomator(
            remote_debugging_port=remote_debugging_port, unique_process_id=unique_process_id
    ) as automator:
        # Variant 1: Work with the BrowserAutomator API
        await automator.page.goto("https://playwright.dev/python/")
        if unique_process_id:
            # With Automator, you can call function from the BrowserAutomationStudio API.
            print("Unique process ID: %s", unique_process_id)
            page_content = await automator.bas_get_page_content()

            elem = automator.page.locator("xpath=//a[@class='getStarted_Sjon']")
            await automator.bas_move_mouse_to_elem(elem=elem)
            await elem.click()

            print("Page content from BAS_SAFE api: %s ...", page_content[:100])

        # Variant 1: Work with the Playwright API directly.
        ws_endpoint = automator.get_ws_endpoint()
        async with async_playwright() as pw:
            # Connect to an existing browser instance using the fetched WebSocket endpoint.
            browser = await pw.chromium.connect_over_cdp(ws_endpoint)
            # Access the main page of the connected browser instance.
            page = browser.contexts[0].pages[0]
            # Perform actions using Playwright, like navigating to a webpage.
            await page.goto("https://playwright.dev/python/")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Planned Improvements:

- [x] Add Proxy support.
- [ ] Include build scripts for converting Python files to executable format.
- [ ] Expand the repository with more illustrative examples.
- [ ] Develop end-to-end tests to thoroughly assess the entire workflow.
